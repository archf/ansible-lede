  All you need is a ssh acces to your target openwrt system. Run your play by
  with "remote_user: root".

description: |
  A role to configure openwrt. It works using a custom shell module to avoid requiring python on the target.
  This is greatly inspired from the work of lefant. I gathered all his work on a single module
  wich i slightly modified.

  See [this role]("https://github.com/lefant/ansible-openwrt") or ansible-openwrt on ansible-galaxy
